# WARNING: Be careful about upgrading the spl-governance dependency!
#          Recently the discriminator for new VoterWeightRecord accounts has changed, and upgrading
#          this dependency here without also upgrading the spl-governance program instance beforehand
#          would lead to VWR accounts that are unusable until the spl-governance program is upgraded.
